# Overview

'One Friday in Berlin' is a JavaScript game made with the Canvas API.

<br>

## Premise

The premise of the game is that it's Friday night in Berlin, and you're going out with your friends.

The game consists of info screens, and two mini-games.

The info screens preceed the mini-games and tell you what is happening in the story. They also tell you the objective of the game is and what controls to use.

The first game involves crossing a busy road to get to the bar where your friends are.

The second game involves the player drinking beer, which you do by collecting the beer bottles that are falling from the top of the screen.

Unfortunately, every game ends with the player drinking too much, passing out, and needing to be brought home by their friends.

At this point, you can restart the game and play again.
